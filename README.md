# AI-Based IDS/IPS System

## Project Description
This project implements an AI-powered Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS)
using Python, Tkinter GUI, and a locally hosted AI model (Ollama).

The system:
- Detects known malicious IPs using a CSV dataset
- Identifies zero-day (unknown) IP threats
- Blocks or monitors suspicious traffic
- Provides AI-based security explanations
- Uses multithreading to prevent GUI freezing

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- CSV Dataset
- Requests (API communication)
- Ollama (Local AI Model)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files Included
- `ids_ips_project.ipynb` → Main project notebook
- `ip_dataset.csv` → IP threat dataset

## How to Run
1. Make sure Ollama is running locally:

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells
4. Enter an IP address when prompted
## Academic Use
This project was developed for academic purposes as part of a information Security course
